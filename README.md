# Project 2: Memory Virtualization
#### This project was produced with the intention to read in a memory trace and simulate the actions of a virtual memory system with a single level page table. The three page replacement algorithms implemented for this simulator are:
1. FIFO (First In, First Out)
2. LRU (Least Recently Used)
3. Segmented FIFO
## How to run
#### This is a placeholder :-)
